Parts:
  Raspberry Pi Camera Board v2 - 8 Megapixels [P#3099/29.95/2017-03-12]

Instructions

The project page uses a shell script and associated software to capture
images.   It would be nice to do all this in python.

Required software items:
  * OS: raspbian lite (2017-03-02-raspbian-jessie-lite.img)
  * raspistill (native)

apt-get install wiringpi

For adaptation of the shell script to python:

apt-get install python-picamera python-imaging

Example use of picamera from www.raspberrypi.org:
