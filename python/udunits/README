Implementation of a python module on top of udunits2 C API.

NOTES

This is highly experimental code.  Current code works, but tends to
segfault if used multiple times within a python program.  I believe
this is caused by memory leaks.  If you make code improvements, I will
incorporate them.

Alternate code:
